# Custom OpenFOAM 12 Solver with Scalar Transport for PitzDaily Case

## Project Description

This repository contains a custom OpenFOAM solver, **myFoamRun**, developed to simulate scalar transport alongside flow variables in CFD simulations. The project modifies the default `foamRun` solver by incorporating an advection-diffusion equation for a scalar field `T`, enabling its application in scenarios such as temperature transport, pollutant dispersion, or passive scalar studies.

To demonstrate and validate the solver, a **pitzDaily** test case has been prepared. This classic benchmark case models flow over a backward-facing step, providing a reliable setup for testing scalar transport under transient conditions.
To learn how to integrate a scalar transport equation into a custom OpenFOAM 12 solver and see a working example, check out the article at the link below. For more details and an in-depth walkthrough, please visit:

## Features

- **Custom Solver:**
  - Based on OpenFOAMâ€™s `foamRun` with added support for scalar transport via a `T` field.
  - Implements the steady-state advection-diffusion equation:
    \[
    \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \cdot T) - \nabla \cdot (D_T \nabla T) = 0
    \]

- **pitzDaily Test Case:**
  - Configured to evaluate scalar transport behavior.
  - Includes a defined diffusivity `D_T` and initial/boundary conditions for the scalar field `T`.

- **User-Friendly Setup:**
  - Easy-to-follow instructions for compiling the solver and running the test case.
  - Editable fields in the case directory for customization.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd custom-openfoam-solver
```

### 2. Compile the Solver

Load your OpenFOAM environment
```bash
source /opt/openfoam12/etc/bashrc
```
Clean and compile the solver
```bash
wclean
wmake
```

### 3. Prepare the Case


Navigate to the pitzDaily directory and ensure:
```bash
cd pitzDaily
```
Check that 'constant/transportProperties' includes the diffusivity D_T.
Check that '0/T' file defines initial and boundary conditions for the scalar field.



### 4. Run the Simulation

```bash
myFoamRun
```


### 5. Post-Processing


Visualize the scalar field T and flow results using ParaView or another tool.
Example:
```bash

paraview
```
